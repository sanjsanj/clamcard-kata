# ClamCard

Implement a system for a contactless travel card for the London underground.

* The card does not need to be topped up.
* The card charges the owner's bank account directly when used.
* The card is used by touching in and out at train stations.
* The train system accepting this card has two categorical zones of stations, Zone A and Zone B.
* The stations within the zones are as follows:   

| Zone A  | Zone B  |
|---------|---------|
|Asterisk |Bison      |
|Antelope |Bugel       |
|Aldgate  |Balham       |
|Angel    |Bullhead        |
|Aardvark    |Barbican        |

* Travelling within Zone B is more expensive than travelling in Zone A.
* The price of Zone B is inclusive of travelling within Zone A.

#### The fares are as described below:
|   | Single  |  Day | Week  |Month|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Zone A|£2.50|£7.00|  £40.00|£145.00|
|Zone B|£3.00|£8.00|£47.00|£165.50|

- A Single is a journey from one station to another
- A Day fare includes all single journies made within a single day.
- A Week fare includes all single journies made within a single week.
- A month fare includes all single journies made within a single month.
- If one of the stations is within Zone B at any point in a journey, the price for Zone B will be charged.
- No matter how many journies are made within one of the time boundaries within a particular zone, the price will cap at that time period's fare.
